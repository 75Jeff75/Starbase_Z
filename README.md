Starbase_Z
==========

A simple, text-based adventure game that lets you zap aliens over and over :)

WHAT IT IS:

Starbase Z is a short text-based pace adventure game, primarily written as a response to an exercise Zed Shaw's book
"Learn Python the Hard Way". It is intended to be a bit on the silly side. The exercise did not require writing something this long, 
but I was having fun so I just let things roll.  I went through Zed Shaw’s Python book up to the part where he teaches defining functions.  
Then I thought I would make a game partly to teach myself coding, and partly for a creative outlet.  
In essence, this is built linearly, calling function by function, and not done the “object-oriented” way.  
I am going to go through more exercises in his book, and then come back to this when I have more experience under my belt. 

HOW TO END THE GAME

The game runs from a main menu, so you can quit any time by selecting “Retire” from the Operations sub-menu.

CAVEATS:

Right now, there is no shop in the game (that’s because I have a hunch it will be easier to make a shop the object-oriented way).    
Therefore, there’s not much incentive to put points in the SCIENG skill. 
Also, you cannot improve your weaponry at this point (except by repairing your ship).

GOALS:

Short Term Goals:

-          Better formatting for the text
-          More variance in pilot abilities and enemy ship attributes (again, I have a hunch this is better done the OOP way)
-          A “high score” record keeper
-          Better formulas for: The end-game score, “myhitchance”, and damage
-          A working shop with random inventory.
-          The alien’s cultures actually meaning something.
- 		   More combat options, such as withdrawing from battle (taking a hit to your fame)


Long-term goals:

-          A randomly generated ASCII starmap, with points of interest.  i.e.: the points of interest in the large map could open up into smaller grids to fight battles.  
-          The map could open up into a smaller 10x10 grid with planets to visit.
-          Some kind of GUI
-          The ability to select missions
-          A backstory.
-          Perhaps combat that is more tactical in nature
- 		   Hand to hand combat abilities -- 3 areas: Mindcraft (wizardry), Scrapping (melee), Guns (ranged), Subterfuge (rogue stuff).

COMMENTS:

Please email me with any feedback you might have, especially:

- What your high score was
- What features might be cool to put in
- Where I can look to find sample code that simulates a shop or economy
- Where to find good explanations of OOP (because I am stuck on that topic now)
