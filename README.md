Starbase_Z
==========

A simple, text-based adventure game that lets you zap aliens over and over :)

WHAT IT IS:

Starbase Z is a short text-based pace adventure game, primarily written as a response to an exercise Zed Shaw's book
"Learn Python the Hard Way". It is intended to be a bit on the silly side. I will come back to this and create a longer game using classes when I have more experience under my belt. 

HOW TO END THE GAME

The game runs from a main menu, so you can quit any time by selecting “Retire” from the Operations sub-menu.

GOALS:

I re-made this game as a fantasy version with more features and called it "Barbarian".
