A simple, text-based adventure game that lets you zap aliens over and over :)

WHAT IT IS:

Starbase Z is a short text-based pace adventure game, primarily written as a response to an exercise Zed Shaw's book
"Learn Python the Hard Way". It is intended to be a bit on the silly side. I will come back to this and create a longer game using classes when I have more experience under my belt. 

HOW TO END THE GAME

The game runs from a main menu, so you can quit any time by selecting “Retire” from the Operations sub-menu.

GOALS:

Short Term Goals:

-       Better formatting for the text
-       More variance in pilot abilities and enemy ship attributes 
-       A “high score” record keeper
-       Better formulas for: The end-game score, “myhitchance”, and damage
-       A working shop with random inventory.
-       The alien’s cultures actually meaning something.
- 		  More combat options, such as withdrawing from battle (taking a hit to your fame)

Long-term goals:

-       A randomly generated ASCII starmap, with points of interest.
-       Some kind of GUI
-       The ability to select missions
-       A backstory.
-       Perhaps combat that is more tactical in nature
- 		  Hand to hand combat abilities

COMMENTS:

Please email me with any feedback you might have, especially:

- What your high score was
- What features might be cool to put in
- Where I can look to find sample code that simulates a shop or economy
- Where to find good explanations of OOP
